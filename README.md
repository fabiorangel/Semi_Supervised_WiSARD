# Semi_supervised_WiSARD

### Paper:
#### Abstract:

Text categorization is a problem which can be addressed by a semi-super- vised learning classifier, since the annotation process is costly and pon- derous. The semi-supervised approach is also adequate in the context of social network text categorization, due to its adaptation to class distribu- tion changes. This article presents a novel approach for semi-supervised learning based on WiSARD classifier (SSW), and compares it to other al- ready established mechanisms (S3VM and NB-EM), over three different datasets. The novel approach showed to be up to fifty times faster than S3VM and EM-NB with competitive accuracies.
